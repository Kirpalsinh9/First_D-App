# First_D-App
To run the App:
npm install 

node index.js


This is just Decentralized App that connects the contract which is already deployed on ethereum test net blockchain[Koovan]. 
Anyone can call the functions of the contract by running the index.js file and perform any functionality of the contract through terminal and later on we can use this js file to develop the whole app that will also be having front end.
